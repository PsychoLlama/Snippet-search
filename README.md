# Snippet Search
_A search tool for code snippets_

There's a space between a simple coding problem and
one large enough to warrant an entire library. The simple
code problem is easily solved, and services like GitHub exist
to host the larger projects. What we're missing though, is
a place to find code that doesn't fit either category.

That's where Snippet Search comes in.

Snippet Search lets you find, discuss and publish
short blocks of code. Code snippets solve one small
problem in an unopinionated way, allowing you to
copy & paste them into your own code without breaking it,
while being clear enough to understand and tweak.

If you don't find what you're looking for,
you can always publish your own.
